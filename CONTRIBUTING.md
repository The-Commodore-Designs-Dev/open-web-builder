## How to Report a Bug

To report a bug use the GitHub Issues tab and create a new issue.

### Bug Templates

Bug templates can be found in the .github directory with the form of a YAML file.

Include a title of the bug, a description of the bug, steps to reproduce the bug, an expected outcome
without the bug, and the actual outcome with the bug.

### First Bugs for Contributors

If the fix is easy then someone will review the issue and label it as "good first issue". These 
will be saved for the developers that are new to the project and have never made a commit before.

## How to Submit Changes

```
git clone

git flow start feature [name of feature]

git push origin [name of branch]
```

Other way is to fork the project:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git flow  start feature feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Then open a pull request for the feature to be reviewed to be merged with master
and made a release package.

## How to Request an "Enhancement"
